    "Importing packages\n",

    "To use any functions in a package you must first import the package or the parts of the package you want to employee. For example, below are two different examples of importing. Here is the breakdown of what is happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we are importing the entire pandas package using:\n",
    "```python\n",
    " import pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, we are changing the name of the pandas package in our current program to pd:\n",
    "```python\n",
    " import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "_Doing this saves us a little time in the future as anytime you want to use a function in the pandas package you only have to type `pd` instead of the long word `pandas`._\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next import we only want _part_ of the matplotlib library. Specifically, we want pyplot, a graphical plotting framework. To import only part of a package we first the keyword `from` to indicate which package we want to take from and then `import` that subsection of code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    " from matplotlib import pyplot\n",
    "```\n",
    "When this cell is run pandas will be imported and available as `pd` and `pyplot` from the matplotlib package will be imported."

To activate a tool-tip first click in the text of `DataFrame` in the code cell below then hold down `shift` and press `tab`. A popup should appear giving information about what type of data goes into the DataFrame function and a brief explantation of what this function does.\n",
