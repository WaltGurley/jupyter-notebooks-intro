    "[The Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is a browser-based, open-source tool for sharing interactive code, visualizations, and explanatory text in over 40 programming languages. Jupyter notebooks are used for [everything](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) from data exploration and computational analyses to information presentation and interactive instructional materials for mathematical, statistical, and programming concepts. They are applicable across varied fields but are popular within data sciences, scientific computing, and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the uses for the combined writing of code and rich text, Jupyter notebooks are easily sharable via email, cloud storage services, or GitHub. In particular, GitHub provides rendering of Jupyter notebooks in the browser for easy viewing ([GitHub + Jupyter Notebooks = <3](https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3))."
